how easy was Bitwarden?: Bitwarden was hard to figure out at first but it got easier the more i read to understand it 


Can you see how it is Safer than memorizing weak Passwords?: at first no but then i thought maybe but i still feel like it isn't safer than remembering passwords because it can be hacked your brain cannot but i see it makes it easier and if you need it you can use it but i am a 50/50 on it being safe
