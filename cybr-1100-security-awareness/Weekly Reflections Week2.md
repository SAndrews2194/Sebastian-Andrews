I have not personally encountered a cyber attack and I have only heard of cyber attacks. Unsafe passwords are something I do know about but I have never had anything go bad. I was taught to not give passwords to people and don’t go to weird looking websites. I was being smart, caution is better than thinking you're fine and being prideful and I like to be safe then sorry. But I am not sure how to finish this. I have encountered viruses sure but nothing bad except one that locked my phone permanently. I had to rest my phone when I was around 12 years old and it wasn’t the best idea. That is why I don't do that anymore. I have nothing more to say. How I would have handled it was not doing what I did and I would have been smarter about it. I wish I had this info when I was younger.
